# BooksApp
A simple application that let's you add books to an internal SQLite database. This project works with the following dependencies:

- Retrolambda
- SugarOrm

This is a native Android application. The ActionBar has been removed, and instead of the ActionBar, a ToolBar has been added. This is more customizable.
